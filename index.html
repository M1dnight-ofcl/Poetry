    <p class="desc">
      This was created by <a href="https://m1dnight.is-a.dev" class="paralink">M1dnightDev</a> for a school project assigned on poetry. The Idea behind the assignment was to give students the opportunity to unlease their creativity into their project instead of writing essays. M1dnight, being the person he is, decided to make a website after his teacher recommended the idea to him.
